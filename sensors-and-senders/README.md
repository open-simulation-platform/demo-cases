# Sensors and Senders

This repository consists simple sensors FMUs for GPS, VRU, Gyro and Wind sensors. It also contains network FMUs implementing the NMEA protocol for each sensors.

An OSP-IS file is included for each FMU as well as a `OspSystemStructure.xml` connecting the FMUs. 

IP and port of the network FMUS can be changed by modifying their `NmeaConfig.json` file located in the FMU's resources folder.

## Source Code
The source code for these FMUs can be found [here](https://github.com/open-simulation-platform/sensors-and-senders)
